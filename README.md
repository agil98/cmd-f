## Foodie
Project submission for cmd-f 2019 hackathon.

A user would upload an image of a meal and the bot will output similar recipes to the item provided.
The project makes use of [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/).

The project is not completed, it currently just uses the google API to extract labels from given images. The goal is to take the labels and make use of the recipe API to find recipes based off the given image.
